# ROPEs-Project-2020 #
First time using AI/machine learning.

Source.cpp is the main program which you should run, and digits.png is the dataset. In Single Tests there are single test digits that were used just to see the limits of my program. The file deskewtest.cpp was used to debug deskewing images (making the digit upright and not slanted). The rest of the PNG files are images I used to first input and output images using OpenCV.

Using the program:
    Make sure you have OpenCV installed and linked with Visual Studio (tutorial here: https://medium.com/@subwaymatch/adding-opencv-4-2-0-to-visual-studio-2019-project-in-windows-using-pre-built-binaries-93a851ed6141). I used Visual Studio 2019 and OpenCV 4.2.0.
    I think any color works; it's not limited to black background with white digit.
    Only one digit per image; if you try in give it an image of 25, it will only return one digit which is a blend of the two (maybe 8 in this case?).
    Don't use this program while in a bathtub. If you do, it results may not be accurate.
    Don't use this program when hunting ducks.
