# ROPEs-Project-2020
First time using AI/machine learning.

Source.cpp is the main program which you should run, and digits.png is the dataset. In Single Tests there are single test digits that were used just to see the limits of my program. The file deskewtest.cpp was used to debug deskewing images (making the digit upright and not slanted). The rest of the PNG files are images I used to first input and output images using OpenCV.

Make sure you have OpenCV installed. I used Visual Studio 2019 and OpenCV 4.2.0.

Maybe my code isn't the most efficient, but that's probably because I went back to make it user friendly.
